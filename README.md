TypeCompose provides some classes & instances for forms of type composition, as well as some modules that haven't found another home.  The [wiki page](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TypeCompose) contains a description and links to documentation.

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal commands.
