TypeCompose provides some classes & instances for forms of type
composition.  It also includes a very simple implementation of data-driven
computation.  See the description and link to documentation:

  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TypeCompose

Please share any comments & suggestions on the discussion (talk) page
there.

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
commands.
