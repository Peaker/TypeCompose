% TypeCompose

TypeCompose provides some classes & instances for forms of type
composition, as well as some modules that haven't found another home.  The
[wiki page] contains a description and links to documentation.

Please share any comments & suggestions on the [talk page] there.

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
commands.
